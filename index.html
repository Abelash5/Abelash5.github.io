      <h3>Abelash Rangarajah</h3>
      <p> Welcome to my portfolio page where I will be sharing my projects done throughout my computer science course and outside of learning hours. I'm currently studying computer science (first year) at City university. I have little experience in programming so i'm curious to be learning about it. Below is my first programming project done in my course which is a java 2D game. </p>

    <h3>Java Game: Fruit Ninja</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project is a java 2d game. It is a simple game of a ninja moving through the levels, avoiding the interference of the enemies to complete the game. There are certain parameters to move to the next level such as the ninja has to collect all the bananas in the current level to advance to the next level. Each level get harder where the amount of enemies/obstructions increases as you progress. Also there are three different weapons the ninja can use which can be functioned by the key pressed type. The ninja needs to avoid being killed by the enemies and the obstructions such as lava. The major challenges I faced was I found it difficult to recognize how my errors was getting caused and took a significant amount of time to rectify it.  Lessons learnt was I'm able to make a clean efficient code, by using encapsulation or general java comments
